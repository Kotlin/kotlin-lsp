  // Note: you'll need to install "Kotlin" extension via Zed extensions: https://github.com/zed-extensions/kotlin
  // See the README.md file for more information on how to configure kotlin-lsp in Zed
  // Also note: diagnostics do not work because they are pull-based in our implementation, but the editor expects them to be push-based
  // Things like navigation, completion, find references and code actions like organize imports do.
